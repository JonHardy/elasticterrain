Elastic Terrain Map
=========

Elastic Terrain Map implements a new method for terrain visualization that uses animation.
The application renders digital elevation models with WebGL and offers many configurable parameters.

Check out the [live demo](http://elasticterrain.xyz). 
The performance is best with an up-to-date version of Google Chrome or Chromium.

Watch [demo movie I](https://vimeo.com/140837757) or [demo movie II](https://vimeo.com/140798332).

The client uses precomputed tiles with encoded terrain data that can be produced from publicly available digital elevation models.
