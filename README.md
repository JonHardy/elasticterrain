Open Terrain Explorer
=========

This project is the further development of [ol3-dem](http://github.com/buddebej/ol3-dem/).
It is based a fork of OpenLayers 3.1.1. 

The Open Terrain Explorer is able to render digital elevation models using webgl and offers various methods to explore terrain.

Set up the development environment as for OpenLayers 3 ([How to Contribute to ol3](https://github.com/buddebej/ote/blob/master/ol3/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

The program works with a set of tiles that can be produced from all common ditigal elevation models using the [dem2tiles](https://github.com/buddebej/dem2tiles).

Run the example with (a sample tileset will be added soon):

```
./build.py serve

```
