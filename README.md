##Elastic Terrain Map

Elastic Terrain Map implements a new method for terrain visualization that uses animation.
The application renders digital elevation models with WebGL and offers many configurable parameters.

### Demo

Check out the [live demo](http://elasticterrain.xyz) at [elasticterrain.xyz)](http://elasticterrain.xyz). 
The performance is best with an up-to-date version of Google Chrome or Chromium.

Watch [demo movie](https://vimeo.com/140798332).

### Getting Started

Clone the repository and browse to the ol3 folder. Run:

```
make install
```

```
make serve
```

Use a browser with enabled CORS to load remote tiles. 

```

```

### Data

The application uses precomputed tiles with encoded terrain data that can be produced from publicly available digital elevation models. For this purpose, we used [a collection of python scripts](https://github.com/buddebej/dem2tiles).
