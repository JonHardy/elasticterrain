Open Terrain Explorer
=========

This is based on [ol3dem](http://github.com/buddebej/ol3dem/) an experimental fork of OpenLayers 3.1.1 to render digital elevation models using the integrated webgl functionality.

Run the example with (a sample tileset will be added soon):

```
./build.py serve

```
