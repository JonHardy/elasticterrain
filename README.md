Elastic Terrain Map
=========

Elastic Terrain Map implements a new method for terrain visualization that uses animation.
The application renders digital elevation models with WebGL and offers many configurable parameters.

Check out the [demo](http://elasticterrain.xyz). 
The performance is best with a up-to-date version of Google Chrome or Chromium.

The client uses precomputed tiles with terrain data that were produced from different publicly available digital elevation models.

This project is based on [ol3-dem](http://github.com/buddebej/ol3-dem/), which is a fork of [OpenLayers 3.1.1](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3).
